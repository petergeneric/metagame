<p>You will notice <strong>dotted lines on the map showing where adjacent neighborhood boundaries</strong> are. This can be useful if you are trailing someone and they leave the boundary of a neighborhood.</p>

<h2>Block Colors</h2>

<p>Neighborhoods are illustrated by colored blocks. The <strong>block color reflects its official zoning</strong>, which is not determinative but merely suggestive of its use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Commercial</li>
  <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Residential</li>
  <li><strong>Gray:</strong> Mixed residential and commercial</li>
  <li><strong>Orange:</strong> Industrial</li>
  <li><strong>Red:</strong> Maritime</li>
  <li><strong>Green:</strong> Park or mixed outdoor</li>
</ul>

<h2>Map Symbols</h2>

<p>You will also notice some small <strong>symbols</strong> on some blocks. The legend for those symbols is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blue bus symbol:</strong> Marks the westmost starting point of a East-West bus line</li>
  <li><strong>Orange subway symbol:</strong> Marks a subway station stop</li>
  <li><strong>Blue shield symbol:</strong> Marks neighborhood police precinct</li>
</ul>
